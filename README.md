This is a quick and dirty way to get a sense of what's trending on Twitter related to a particular Topic. For my use case, I am focusing on the city of Seattle but you can easily apply this to any topic.



This Notebook:

*   Extracts relevant Tags from the text (NER: Named Entity Recognition).
*   Does Sentiment Analysis on those Tweets.
*   Provides some visualizations in an interactive format to get a 'pulse' of what's happening.
